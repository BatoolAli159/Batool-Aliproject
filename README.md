## Problem Statement
Since 2020, Bahrain’s total imports have shown significant changes, reaching their highest levels in 2022–2023.  
This growth indicates increased trade activity and higher demand for imported goods.  
However, it has become challenging to identify the **top contributing countries**, **key commodities**, and **yearly trends**, which makes it difficult to evaluate trade performance and improve import sources.

## Insights and Findings
1. Bahrain’s total imports have shown **strong growth between 2022 and 2023**, reaching their peak in 2023–2024.  
2. **Teabags and roasted coffee** represent the largest share of total import value, reflecting high consumer demand in the local market.  
3. A few key countries — such as **India**, **Free Zone Jebel Ali**, and **Emirates** — dominate Bahrain’s import sources, indicating dependency on limited trading partners.

## Recommendations
1. **Diversify import sources** to reduce dependency on a few trading partners.  
2. **Monitor seasonal trends** to better forecast import needs and demand fluctuations.  
3. **Enhance trade performance analysis** using automated Power BI reports for continuous monitoring.  


## Conclusion
This Power BI project offers valuable insights into Bahrain’s import patterns for coffee, tea, mate, and spices.  
It supports better decision-making by identifying key commodities, dominant trading partners, and evolving yearly trends.
